==========================================
Where we will use Linux OS in Realtime ? 
==========================================

1) Application deployment will happen on linux machines only

2) Tools will be installed on Linux machines only

	Ex: Docker, K8S, Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, ELK etc...

3) Application log files will be stored in linux machine only

==============
What is OS ?
==============

=> It is a software which acts as mediator between user and computer

=> Users will communicate with computers using OS

=> Without OS we can't use any computer

=> OS provides platform to run our applications in computer

	Ex: notepad, calculator, browser, tomcat, eclipse...

=> We have several operating systems in market

	Ex: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, IOS etc...	

===========
Windows OS
===========

=> Developed by Microsoft company (Bill Gates)

=> It is commercial OS (licensed)

=> It is single user based OS

=> Security features are very less in Windows

Note: We need to install anti-virus software to protect files

=> Windows is GUI based OS

=> Windows is recommened for personal use only

Ex: internet browsing, games, watch movies, attend online classes....


=========
Linux OS
=========

=> Linux community based OS

=> Linux is free & open source os

=> Linux is CLI based OS

=> Linux is multi user based OS

=> Security Features are very high in linux

Note: Anti-virus s/w is not required 

=> Linux OS developed by "Linus Torvalds"

=> Linux is highly recommended to manage servers

	Ex: App Severs, DB servers, Docker, Jenkis, K8S etc..

==============
Linux History
==============

-> Linus Torvalds identified some challenges/issues in Unix OS

-> Linus Torvalds identified one OS which is matching with his ideas 

			i.e Minux os	

-> Linus Torvalds used Minux OS code and made some changes and released into market was new OS

		(Li) nus + Mi (nux) ===> Linux

=====================
Linux Distributions
=====================

-> Linus Torvalds provided Linux OS code for free of cost

-> So many companies downloaded Linux OS source code and modified according to their requirement and released into market with their brand names those are called as Linux Distributions/ Linux Flavours.

-> We have 200+ Linux Distributions in the market.

  Ex: Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat, Debian, SUSE, Kali, Fedora....


==============================
How to setup Linux Machine ?
=============================

Approach-1) Install Linux OS directley in computer

Approach-2) We can use Virtual Box and install Linux OS as Guest OS in Windows

Approach-3) Setup Linux VM in AWS Cloud (Recommended)

============================
Setup Linux VM in AWS Cloud
============================

Step-1 : Login into AWS cloud account

Step-2 : Create EC2 Instance (Linux VM) (Amazon Linux)

		instance type : t2.micro (free tier eligible)

================
Linux Commands
================

=> Linux is CLI based OS

=> We will perform operations in linux vm using linux commands


whoami
pwd
date
cal
cal 2025


mkdir : Make directory

		mkdir ashokit
		mkdir java python aws devops

rmdir : Remove empty directory

		rmdir devops

ls : list the files of present working directory

			ls -l : Display in alphabetical order

			ls -lr : Display in reverse of alphabetical order

			ls -lt : Display files based on timestamp (latest on top)

			ls -ltr : Display old files on top & latest at bottom
			
			ls -la : display hidden files (.a)

cd : change directory (navigation)		

			cd <dir-name> : go inside the directory

			cd .. : come out from directory	

touch : To create empty files

			touch f1.txt

			touch f2.txt f3.txt f4.txt	

cat : create file with data + append data to file + print file data	

			cat > f1.txt : Create new file with data

			cat >> f1.txt : Append data to the exiting file data

			cat f1.txt		: Print file data from top to bottom

			cat -n f1.txt : print file data along with line numbers

rm : Remove files

			rm f1.txt : Remove the file

			rm -rf devops : remove non-empty directory

cp : copy the data from one file to another file

			cp f1.txt f2.txt

Note: To copy the data from multiple files we need to use cat command like below

			cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt

mv : rename file/directory + move the file/directory		

			mv linux.txt  linux-os.txt

			mv git.txt  devops/

=======================================================================			

tac : Read file data from bottom to top (opposite of cat cmd)

			tac f1.txt

wc : word count

			wc f1.txt

rev : reverse the file data and print it

			rev f1.txt			

========================================

head : To display file data from top (default 10 lines)

				head app.log

				head -n 20 app.log

				head -n 25 app.log

tail : To display file data from bottom (default 10 lines)

				tail app.log

				tail -n 20 app.log

				tail -n 100 app.log

grep : 	grep stands for global regular expression print 

Note : We will use this grep command for keyword search in file

				grep 'exception' app.log (print lines which contains given keyword)

				grep -i 'exception' app.log (ignore case sensitive)

				grep -n 'java' app.log (print lines along with line num)

				grep -v 'apache' app.log (print lines which don't have apache keyword)

=======================
Text Editors in Linux
=======================

=> vi (visual editor)	it is default editor in linux machines

=> using 'vi' we can create new files and we can edit existing files also

		$ vi f1.txt

=> vi command is having 3 modes

	a) command mode (just to open the file)
	
	b) insert mode (to edit the file) ---> press 'i' in keyboard

	c) esc mode (to comeout from insert mode) --> press 'esc' in keyboard	

    ## Save changes & close the file =>  :wq or :wq!
    
    ## Without saving changes close the file => :q!			


Note: vi command will open the file if it is already avilable otherwise it will create new file and it will open that file.

===================================
File creation commands in linux
===================================

touch : Create empty file

cat : Create file with data

cp : copy one file data into another file

vi : create and open file for editing

====================================
Reading file data commands in linux
====================================

cat : print file data from top to bottom

tac : print file data from bottom to top

rev : print each line in reverse order

head : print top 10 lines of file

tail : print last 10 lines of file

vi : open file 

=============
SED command
=============

=> SED stands for stream editor

=> It is used to process file data

=> Using SED command we can perform operations on the file without opening the file.

# Replace first occurance of linux keyword with unix in every line
sed 's/linux/unix/' linux-os.txt

# Replace second occurance of 'linux' with 'unix' in every line
sed 's/linux/unix/2' linux-os.txt

# Replace all occurances
sed 's/linux/unix/g' linux-os.txt

# Substitute and save changes in original file
sed -i 's/linux/unix/g' linux-os.txt

# delete second line of data in the file
sed -i '2d' linux-os.txt

# delete fourth line of data in the file
sed -i '4d' linux-os.txt

# delete last line of data in the file
sed -i '$d' linux-os.txt

# delete from nth line to last line (n is a number)
sed -i 'n,$d' linux-os.txt

# delete from 2nd line to 10th line
sed -i '2,10d' linux-os.txt

# print data from 3rd line to 6th line
$ sed -n '3,6p' linux-os.txt

# insert data before 4th line
$ sed '4i\i am from ashokit' linux-os.txt

# Add given text after last line
$ sed '$a\i love linux' linux-os.txt


===========================
Working with User Accounts
===========================

=> Linux is a multi user based OS

=> Multiple users can acces single linux machine and can perform multi tasking

Note: "ec2-user" is default user in amazon linux vm

Note: ec-user having sudo priviliges

Note: For every user we can create new account to access linux vm.

# create user
sudo useradd <uname>

# set password for user account
sudo passwd <uname>

# display all users avialable in linux vm
cat /etc/passwd

# switch user
$ sudo su <uname>

# Go to logged in user home directory
$ cd ~

# Delete user account
$ sudo userdel <uname>

# Delete user account along with user home directory
$ sudo userdel <uname> --remove

# how to change username
$ sudo usermod -l <new-name> <old-name>


================================
What is sudoers file in Linux
=================================

=> It is very important configuration file in linux machine.

=> Using this file we can control which user can run command as a superuser.

# print sudoersfile content
$ sudo cat /etc/sudeors

Note: We should be very careful while working with sudoers file. If we do any mistakes in sudoers file then system will be crashed.

########## Giving sudo previliges for user #######

# open suderos file
$ sudo visudo

# configure user like below in sudeors file (after root user details)
<username>  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

=> After making changes to close sudoers file =>  ( CTRL + X + Y + Enter)

========================================================
How to enable password based authentication in linux  ?
========================================================

=> in sshd_config file , by default PassswordBasedAuthentication is no.

=> To enable password based authentication we need to set the value as yes.

# Display sshd_configurration file data
$ sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Open file and enter into insert mode (press 'i')
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# set PassswordBasedAuthentication as yes

# save and close the file ( esc + :wq)

# restart sshd service
# sudo systemctl restart sshd

=====================
Log Server Details
=====================

Public IP : 43.204.143.144
username : loguser
pwd: log@123

# use below command to connect with username and pwd
$ ssh uname@public-ip

Note: To connect with linux vm using username and password then passwordbasedauthentication must be enabled in that linux vm.

===========================
Working with User Groups
===========================

=> When we create user in linux, for every user one user group also will be created with the given username.

# display all groups available
$ cat /etc/group

# create new group
$ sudo groupadd <group-name>

# Add user to group
$ sudo usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name>

# delete user from group
$ sudo gpasswd -d <username> <group-name>


=======================================

1) File permissions & ownership
		chomod & chown

2) Networking commands

3) Package Managers (s/w installation)

4) Linux Architecture		

=================
File Permissions
=================

ec2-user => /home/ec2-user ==> f1.txt

raju => /home/raju ==> f1.txt

rani => /home/rani ==> f2.txt

ashok => /home/ashok ==> f3.txt


=> We can create several user accounts in single linux vm

=> Multiple users can connect to single linux vm at a time.

Note: One user can modify the file created by other user in linux vm.

=> To avoid this problem we will use file permissions in linux

=> In Linux, file permissions are divided into 3 types

		r => read
		w => write
		x => execute

=> A file/directory contains 3 sections of permissions

		user (owner) => u

		group => g

		others => o

=> We can see below permissions for a file & directory

			rwxrwxrwx f1.txt

					user having read + write + execute
					group having read + write + execute
					others having read + write + execute

			rw-r--r-- f2.txt

					user having read & write (no execute permission)
					group having only read
					others having only read
			
			rwxr-xr-x java

					user having read + write + execute
					group having read + execute
					others having read + execute

			r-xr----x sbms

				  user having read + execute
				  group having only read
				  others having only execute


=> To change file permissions we will use 'chmod' command


# Giving execute permission for user
$ chmod u+x f1.txt

# giving write permission for group
$ chmod g+w f1.txt

# Remove execute permission for others
$ chmod o-x f1.txt

# Remove all permissions for others
$ chmod o-rwx f1.txt

# give all permissions for group
$ chmod g+rwx f1.txt

====================================
File Permissions in Numeric Format
====================================

0 => No Permission
1 => Execute
2 => Write
3 => (2+1) => Write + Execute
4 => Read
5 => (4+1) => Read + Execute
6 => (4+2) => Read + Write
7 => (4+2+1) => Read + Write + Execute

$ chmod 765 f1.txt

		- user having all permissions
		- group having read + write
		- others having read + execute

$ chmod 456 f1.txt

		- user having only read
		- group having read + execute
		- others having read + write


====================
Ownership change
====================

=> To change file/directory ownership we will use 'chown' command

# changing owner
sudo chown new-owner file/directory

# changing owner-group
sudo chown :new-group file/directory

# changing owner & group
sudo chown new-owner:new-group file/directory


============================================
Q) What is the diff between chmod & chown ?
============================================

chmod => To change file/directory permissions

chown => To change owner/group

=====================
Networking Commands
=====================

ping :  To check connectivity

		$ ping www.google.com
		$ ping www.google.com
		$ ping 192.168.1.20

wget : It is used to download the files from internet

		$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.91/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.91.zip

curl : To send http request to server (api call)

		$ curl https://type.fit/api/quotes

ifconfig: To get IP address of our machine

		$ ifconfig

=======================================

==========================
Package Managers in Linux
==========================

=> Package Managers are used to install softwares in linux machines

=> Package Managers are specific to linux distribution

		Amazon Linux + Red HAT : yum

		Ubuntu Linux + Debian : apt


#install git client s/w
sudo yum install git -y	

# install java s/w
sudo yum install java

# install maven s/w
sudo yum install maven

================================
Install WebServer in Linux VM
================================

=> Webserver is a software which is used to run websites

=> Websites are divided into 2 types

		1) static website (fixed content)

				ex : wikipedia

		2) dyanmic website (content will change based on user)

			  ex: gmail, facebook

=> For static websites execution we can use 'httpd' as webserver

=> For dynamic websites execution we can use 'tomcat' as webserver


# install httpd webserver
sudo yum install httpd -y

# start httpd server
sudo service httpd start

Note: httpd webserver runs on http protocol which is 80.

##### To access our webserver we need to enable 80 port number in EC2 VM security group inbound rules (firewell setting) ####

=> Access our webserver using EC2 VM public ip address in our browser.

# Navigate to webserver directory
cd /var/www/html

# create index.html file with content
sudo vi index.html


=============================
What is systemctl in linux ?
=============================

=> systemctl is a command-line utility in Linux systems which is used to manage system services


=> Starting service
=> stopping service
=> restarting  service
=> reloading service
=> enabling / disabling services


#check service status
sudo systemctl status <service_name>

#start service
sudo systemctl start <service_name>

#stop service
sudo systemctl stop <service_name>

#re-start service
sudo systemctl restart <service_name>


=====================================
How to change hostname in linux vm ?
=====================================

# set hostname
$ sudo hostname <new-name>

# re-start session 
$ exit 

Note: Connect back to linux vm using ssh command.

=================
whereis command
================

To know the location of the package we have installed

whereis java

whereis maven

whereis git

==============
find command
===============

=> find command is used to search files location

# find the file whose name is oops.txt
sudo find /home -name oops.txt

# find all the empty files inside /home
sudo find /home -type f -empty

# find all the empty directories inside /home
sudo find /home -type d -empty

# find the files which are 30 days old in linux vm
sudo find /home -mtime 30 -print
